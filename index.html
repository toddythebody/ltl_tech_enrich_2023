            <p>Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute.  If you've ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe's author as a programmer.  The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow.  The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!</p>

                <p>Python is a programming language that has many different applications.  Programmers can use Python to analyze data, visualize data, and even create art!</p>

                <p>Python has become a key language for data analysis.  Python is faster to write than other languages and includes features called packages.</p>

                <p>Python is similar to other programming languages.  Once you learn one programming language, it is easier to learn another.  Programmers have found this to be true, especially if the new language closely matches the first.  If you would like to pick up R later on, it will be easier already knowing Python!</p>

            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.  HTML describes the structure of a Web page, and consists of a series of elements.  Elements tell the browser how to display the content.  They label pieces of content such as "this is a heading," "this is a paragraph," "this is a link," etc.</p>
